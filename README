Mess with Process
========
This simple module will overwrite memory of any C program process. This was tested on kernel version 5.13.0-52-generic, x86_64.

mwp stands for "mess with process", we only support writing to the arguments section of the process, that is, 'argv', but with the huge loop we have when we loop through the memory, it is possible for you to also overwrite envp (Environment variables).

You have to pass the PID of the process you want to write to when _insmod'ing_ the module, eg. _insmod mwp.ko PID=x_

Let's say you want to overwrite argv[0], that is, _./main_, you simply do _echo "./main ./nomain" > /proc/mwp/mwpk_. This will overwrite the memory region or argv[0] with _./nomain_. You can test it with by using the _main.c_ file that is in _test_ (:

No features will be implemented, at least not soon. Enjoy what you have. I've learned a lot.
