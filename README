This simple module will overwrite the argv arguments of any C program process. This was tested on 5.13.0-52-generic.
You have to pass the PID of the process you want to write to when insmod'ing the module, eg. insmod noargv.ko PID=x
I don't know how safe it is, we write 1024 into the process stack and I believe some data might get corrupted.
That is because the address of `argv` doesn't match the address of `mm->arg_start`, so I just said f it and wrote 1024 bytes of X.
